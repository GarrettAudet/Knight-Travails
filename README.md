Knight's Tour Problem Using Graph Theory

This project utilizes graph theory to solve the "Knight's Tour" problem on a standard 8x8 chessboard using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The knight's move in chess is unique as it moves in an "L" shape: two steps in one direction and one step perpendicular, or one step in one direction and two steps perpendicular. This project will model these movements on a graph and explore paths between two points on the board.
